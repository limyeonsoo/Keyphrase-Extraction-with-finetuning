utility-based anonymization using local recoding privacy becomes a more and more serious concern in applications involving microdata . recently , efficient anonymization has attracted much research work . most of the previous methods use global recoding , which maps the domains of the quasi-identifier attributes to generalized or changed values . however , global recoding may not always achieve effective anonymization in terms of discernability and query answering accuracy using the anonymized data . moreover , anonymized data is often for analysis . as well accepted in many analytical applications , different attributes in a data set may have different utility in the analysis . the utility of attributes has not been considered in the previous methods . in this paper , we study the problem of utility-based anonymization . first , we propose a simple framework to specify utility of attributes . the framework covers both numeric and categorical data . second , we develop two simple yet efficient heuristic local recoding methods for utility-based anonymization . our extensive performance study using both real data sets and synthetic data sets shows that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art multidimensional global recoding methods in both discernability and query answering accuracy . furthermore , our utility-based method can boost the quality of analysis using the anonymized data .
