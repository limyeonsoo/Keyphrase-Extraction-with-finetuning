distributed data mining in a chain store database of short transactions in this paper , we broaden the horizon of traditional rule mining by introducing a new framework of causality rule mining in a distributed chain store database . specifically , the causality rule explored in this paper consists of a sequence of triggering events and a set of consequential events , and is designed with the capability of mining non-sequential , inter-transaction information . hence , the causality rule mining provides a very general framework for rule derivation . note , however , that the procedure of causality rule mining is very costly particularly in the presence of a huge number of candidate sets and a distributed database , and in our opinion , can not be dealt with by direct extensions from existing rule mining methods . consequently , we devise in this paper a series of level matching algorithms , including level matching ( abbreviatedly as lm ) , level matching with selective scan ( abbreviatedly as lms ) , and distributed level matching ( abbreviatedly as distibuted lm ) , to minimize the computing cost needed for the distributed data mining of causality rules . in addition , the phenomena of time window constraints are also taken into consideration for the development of our algorithms . as a result of properly employing the technologies of level matching and selective scan , the proposed algorithms present good efficiency and scalability in the mining of local and global causality rules . scale-up experiments show that the proposed algorithms scale well with the number of sites and the number of customer transactions . index terms : knowledge discovery , distributed data mining causality rules , triggering events , consequential events
