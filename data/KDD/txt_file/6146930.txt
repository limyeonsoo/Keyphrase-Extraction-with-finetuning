a two-way visualization method for clustered data we describe a novel approach to the visualization of hierarchical clustering that superimposes the classical dendrogram over a fully synchronized low-dimensional embedding , thereby gaining the benefits of both approaches . in a single image one can view all the clusters , examine the relations between them and study many of their properties . the method is based on an algorithm for low-dimensional embedding of clustered data , with the property that separation between all clusters is guaranteed , regardless of their nature . in particular , the algorithm was designed to produce embeddings that strictly adhere to a given hierarchical clustering of the data , so that every two disjoint clusters in the hierarchy are drawn separately .
